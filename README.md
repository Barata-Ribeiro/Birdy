# Birdy 🐦

Birdy is an Instagram-like social media platform for bird enthusiasts to share and explore various bird species through their photographs. This repository contains both the RESTful API and the Frontend implementation of Birdy, providing a robust social network for user interactions, photo uploads, comments, and more. The API is a robust and scalable backend service designed to support
Birdy. It handles user authentication, photo uploads, comments, likes,
followings, and provides essential security features to ensure user data
protection. It's built with Node.js and TypeORM.

## Setup 💻
_TO BE ADDED_ <br/><br/>
Both the client and server services are being rebuilt from scratch. You can access the old version [here](https://github.com/Barata-Ribeiro/Birdy/tree/birdy_react).
