# Birdy - Frontend 🖼️

The front end of Birdy is designed to provide users with an intuitive and
responsive interface to interact with the platform. It is built using NextJs,
allowing for a dynamic and efficient user experience, and server-side rendering
for a faster response. The project is based on the 'Dogs' social network, which
is also an Instagram-like app for photo sharing, with the difference being that
'Birdy' is for bird enthusiasts while 'Dogs' is for dog enthusiasts.
